### Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are at the level of items in orders by user. There are user
/ order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variable – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes. For the first observation, the order\_id is 1 and the product\_id
is 49302. The item is Bulgarian Yogurt, which has been ordered before.
The product is in the yogurt aisle and dairy eggs department. For the
4th observation, the order\_id is also 1 and the product\_id is 49683.
The item is Cucumber Kirby, which hasn’t been ordered before. The
product is in the fresh vegetables aisle and produce department. These
two items are ordered together by user 112108.

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>%
  filter(rank < 4) %>%
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

### Problem 2

``` r
accel = read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute_of_day",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    weekday_vs_weekend = case_when(
      day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") ~ "weekday",
      day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday") ~ "weekend"
    ),
    minute_of_day = as.numeric(minute_of_day),
    day = as.factor(day)
  ) %>%
  select(week, day_id, day_name = day, everything())
```

The dataset accel contains 50400 observations and 6 columns. Variables
include week, day\_id, day\_name, minute\_of\_day, activity\_count, and
weekday\_vs\_weekend.

Aggregate accross minutes to create a total activity variable for each
day, and create a table showing these totals.

``` r
accel %>%
  group_by(week, day_name = forcats::fct_relevel(day_name, c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))) %>%
  summarise(total_activity = sum(activity_count)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

| week | day\_name | total\_activity |
| ---: | :-------- | --------------: |
|    1 | Monday    |        78828.07 |
|    1 | Tuesday   |       307094.24 |
|    1 | Wednesday |       340115.01 |
|    1 | Thursday  |       355923.64 |
|    1 | Friday    |       480542.62 |
|    1 | Saturday  |       376254.00 |
|    1 | Sunday    |       631105.00 |
|    2 | Monday    |       295431.00 |
|    2 | Tuesday   |       423245.00 |
|    2 | Wednesday |       440962.00 |
|    2 | Thursday  |       474048.00 |
|    2 | Friday    |       568839.00 |
|    2 | Saturday  |       607175.00 |
|    2 | Sunday    |       422018.00 |
|    3 | Monday    |       685910.00 |
|    3 | Tuesday   |       381507.00 |
|    3 | Wednesday |       468869.00 |
|    3 | Thursday  |       371230.00 |
|    3 | Friday    |       467420.00 |
|    3 | Saturday  |       382928.00 |
|    3 | Sunday    |       467052.00 |
|    4 | Monday    |       409450.00 |
|    4 | Tuesday   |       319568.00 |
|    4 | Wednesday |       434460.00 |
|    4 | Thursday  |       340291.00 |
|    4 | Friday    |       154049.00 |
|    4 | Saturday  |         1440.00 |
|    4 | Sunday    |       260617.00 |
|    5 | Monday    |       389080.00 |
|    5 | Tuesday   |       367824.00 |
|    5 | Wednesday |       445366.00 |
|    5 | Thursday  |       549658.00 |
|    5 | Friday    |       620860.00 |
|    5 | Saturday  |         1440.00 |
|    5 | Sunday    |       138421.00 |

According to the table, we can notice that the male usually had more
activity accounts on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
Additionally, the activity count seems more stable in week 2 and week 3.

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.

``` r
accel %>%
  mutate(day_name = forcats::fct_relevel(day_name, c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = minute_of_day, y = activity_count, color = day_name)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
  title = "Activity plot",
    caption = "Data from the accel dataset"
  )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

<img src="p8105_hw3_xq2197_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

We can observe from the graph that the male tended to move more on
Sunday noon and Friday night. On other days, the activity count of the
male were relatively more stable.

### Problem 3

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
nyweather = 
  ny_noaa %>%
  mutate(
    ny_noaa,
    prcp = prcp/10,
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax)/10,
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin)/10
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  separate(date, c("year", "month", "day"))
```

This dataset records the weather conditions for all New York stations
from January 1, 1981 through December 31, 2010, which contains 1222433
rows and 9 columns. Variables include year, month, day, prcp
(precipitation (mm)), snow (snowfall (mm)), snwd (snow depth (mm)), tmax
(maximum temperature (degrees C)), and tmin (minimum temperature
(degrees C)). The original dataset contains 2595176 observations, and
1372743 observations with missing data were removed, so missing data is
an important issue.
